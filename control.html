R button or the right trigger on the 3DS or Wii U will shield you but be carful if the shield breaks it will stun you. and L button or trigger will grab your opponent. Now with the Smash Ball,
You have to hit it. Once you hit it a few times, it will break and surround you in aura. Press B to unleash your Final Smash. Now you depending on your character you can be a certian range away from
