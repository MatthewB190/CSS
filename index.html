		Brawlhalla one of the best free games around. A 2D fighting game similar to super smash bros. Now some of you are saying "OOOOH SMASH BROS IS THE BEST NOTHING CAN COMPARE"<br>
		And I'm gonna be honest your right, nothing can compare to smash bros. But this game has its on unique qualities. Custom characters made from scratch and custom weapons.<br>
		brawlhalla, unlike SSB has only a select few weapons. Guns, sword, hammer, rocket lance, gauntlets, spear, axe, scythe, and bow. Each character will have a combination with two weapons from the list of weapons.<br>
		know you might be wondering "what are these characters you are talking about. Well if you look down you will see two boxes. Read the one on the left. and click the link for more information about characters.<br>
		I would also read he one on the right too. It has information about the recent update and about the new character.

		Brawlhalla has a lot of characters. They come out with one almost every major update. The latest few have the latest weapon, the scythe. Those characters would be Mirage, Nix and the newly added character Mordex. If you want to play brawlhalla and you haven't played it before you have to use the weekly rotated free characters. I recommend saving up 5400+ coins to buy a really good character. All characters have 4 stats. Attack (power), Dexterity (move speed), Defense (self explanatory) and Speed (again self explanatory). If your like me you want a tanky power house like Cross or a speedy power house like Mordex. But there are a lot of different characters that you can use. With tons of different stats. using this link you can see a list of all the characters.
		<a href="http://wiki.brawlhalla.com/w/Brawlhalla" target="_blank">http://wiki.brawlhalla.com/w/Brawlhalla</a>. That Wiki is updated and shows you combos and lots more for any character your looking to main.

		Okay so the last 3 recent updates have brought us a lot of things. Update one brought us a new character (Mirage) with a brand new weapon.(The Scythe) The next one brought us the character Nix. Also With the scythe.
		The next and latest update brought us a lot of stuff. A new weekly rotated minigame with a 300 coin win bonus. But it laso brought us the character hyped since PAX, Mordex. I might be biased right now but I love Mordex. He is a quick power house.
		With the weapon combonation of the Scythe and my personal favourite weapon, the gauntlets. Mirage's second weapon is the spear and Nix second weapon are the guns. For more Brawlhalla news click the link.
