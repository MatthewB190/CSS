<h1>Tiers</h1>
So Tiers are for competitive players. They tell you how good your character is overall. S tier is the best and F is the worst. Now in no means do you have to pick the best character. Pick the one with
the play style that suits you. Now if you want to test some characters hop into training and check out those top tier characters and see how you like them. Now if you look up Super Smash Bros 4 tier lists.
You will find different ones than the one linked at the top of the page and thats because they are all different. I researched and this one looked the most balenced and is the one I agreed with most. So go fourth Smash 4 players.
If you have read all four sections than leap into the world of smash, and go Smash some noobs.
