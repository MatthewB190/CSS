Street fighter and Cloud from final fantasy. You got characters from Mario like Mario, Luigi Peach, Bowser, Donkey Kong and some new comers Rosalina and Bower Jr. Then Some Pokemon, Pikachu, Charizard
Lucario, a newcomer Greninja and DLC Mewtwo. You got solo characters from their games, Sonic, Mega Man Wii Fit Trainer, Olimar, and Nintendos R.O.B. So just reading this you can see there is a huge roster and
